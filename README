THE CLICK MODULAR ROUTER
========================

    This is the README file for the source release for the Click modular
software router. More recent information may be available on the Web at

	http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/click/

    Click is a modular router toolkit. To use it you'll need to know how to
compile and install the software, how to write router configurations, and
how to write new elements. Our ACM Transactions on Computer Systems paper,
available from the Web site, will give you a feeling for what Click can
do. Using the optimization tools under CLICKDIR/tools, you can get even
better performance than that paper describes.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

    The 'INSTALL' file in this directory contains installation
instructions. User documentation is in the 'doc' subdirectory. This
directory contains manual pages for the Click language, the Linux kernel
module, and several tools; it also has a script that generates manual pages
for many of the elements distributed in this package. To install these
manual pages so you can read them, follow the 'INSTALL' instructions, but
'make install-man' instead of 'make install'.


RUNNING A CLICK ROUTER
----------------------

    Before playing with a Click router, you should get familiar with the
Click configuration language. You use this to tell Click how to process
packets. The language describes a graph of "elements", or packet processing
modules. See the 'doc/click.5' manual page for a detailed description, or
check the 'conf' directory for some simple examples.

    Click can be compiled as a user-level program or as a kernel module for
Linux. Either driver can receive and send packets; the kernel module
directly interacts with device drivers, while the user-level driver uses
packet sockets (on Linux) or the pcap library (everywhere else).

User-Level Program
..................

    Run the user-level program by giving it the name of a configuration
file: 'click CONFIGFILE'.

Linux Kernel Module
...................

    See the 'doc/click.o.8' manual page for a detailed description. To
summarize, install a configuration by running 'click-install CONFIGFILE'.
This will also install the kernel module if necessary and report any errors
to standard error. (You must run 'make install' before 'click-install' will
work.)

NS-3 Simulator
..............

    See 'INSTALL' for more information on how to enable the NS-3 Click
Integration. Further information on ns-3-click is available in the ns-3
manual: http://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/click.html

NS-2 Simulator
..............

    See 'INSTALL' for more information.  Once a Click-enabled version of NS-2
is installed, the 'ns' command is able to run Click scripts as part of a
normal NS-2 simulation.

Configurations
..............

    A few configurations are included in the 'conf' directory, including a
Perl script that generated the IP router configurations used in our TOCS
paper ('conf/make-ip-conf.pl') and a set of patterns for the Click pattern
optimizer, click-xform ('conf/ip.clickpat'). Please check back to our Web
site for more up-to-date configurations.


ADDING YOUR OWN ELEMENTS
------------------------

    Please see the FAQ in this directory to learn how to add elements to
Click.

    Element code that uses only Click's interfaces will *not* be
