StoreUDPTimeSeqRecord([I<keywords> OFFSET, DELTA])

=s timestamps

=d

StoreUDPTimeSeqRecord element can be handy when computing end-to-end UDP packet
delays.  The element embeds a timestamp and a sequence number into a packet and
adjusts the checksum of the UDP packet.  Once the initial timestamp has been
placed into the payload of the UDP packet, a time difference can be computed
once a packet passes through another StoreUDPTimeSeqRecord element.  The data can be
accessed by examining the packet payload (e.g., do a tcpdump and then do post
processing of the data).  The element uses partial checksums to speed up the
processing.  The element works with IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  In case of IPv6,
it assumes that the next header field is UDP.  If this is not the case, the
element will discard the packet.

Packet payload found after the UDP header.  Note, the UDP payload must be at least
22 bytes long.  The values will be stored in network byte order.

uint32_t seq_num
uint32_t initial_second
uint32_t initial_nano_second
uint32_t difference_second
uint32_t difference_nano_second

Keyword arguments are:

=over 2

=item OFFSET

Number of bytes to offset from the beginning of the packet where the IPv4/6 header can be found.
If raw Ethernet packets are fed into this element, then OFFSET needs to be 14.

=item DELTA

Determines which time values are set. If DELTA is false (the default), then the initial_second
and initial_nano_second values are set to the current time, and the difference values are set to 0.
If DELTA is true, then the initial values are left as is, and the difference values are set to
the difference between the current time and the packet's initial time.
