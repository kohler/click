/*
 * =c
 * ACKRetrySender2(I<KEYWORDS>)
 *
 * =s Grid
 * Resend packets until a positive acknowledgement is received.
 *
 * =d
 *
 * This element (and ACKResponder2) is essentially the same as
 * ACKRetrySender, except it encapsulates the data packets with a
 * mini-header so that link-layer broadcast packets can be used to
 * avoid link-layer retransmissions (as in 802.11).
 *
 * Input 0 should be packets with a destination IP address annotation
 * set.  Input 1 should be acknowledgements from an ACKResponder2.
 * When a packet is pulled in on input 0, it is encapsulated with a
 * Retry Header, pushed on output 0, and cached until a positive
 * acknowledgement (ACK) is received.  If no ACK is received before
 * the resend timer expires, the packet is resent.  If the packet has
 * been resent too many times, it is pushed to output 1.  If output 1
 * is not connected, it is dropped.
 *
 * Output 0 should pass through an EtherEncap which puts encapsulated
 * the packet with this node's source ether address, the broadcast
 * ether dest, and the ACKRetry data ethertype (typically 0x7ffb).
 *
 * Keyword arguments are:
 *
 * =over 8
 *
 * =item IP
 *
 * This node's IP address.  Required argument.
 *
 * =item MAX_TRIES
 *
 * Unsigned integer, > 0.  Send the packet up to this many times
 * before giving up.  Default is 16.  This includes the initial
 * transmission.
 *
 * =item TIMEOUT
 *
 * Unsigned integer, > 0.  Milliseconds.  Wait this long before
 * resending the packet.  Default is 10.
 *
 * =item HISTORY_SZ
 *
 * Unsigned integer.  Number of most recent packets for which to
 * remember retry data.  Defaults to 500.
 *
 * =item VERBOSE
 *
 * Boolean.  Be noisy.  True by default.
 *
 * =back
 *
 * =h summary read-only
 * Print summary of packet retry statistics
 *
 * =h history read-only
 * Print packet retry history.
 *
 * =h clear write-only
 * Clear out packet retry history.
 *
 * =h reset write-only
 * Reset packet retry statistics.
 * =a
 * ACKResponder2, ACKRetrySender, ACKResponder, EtherEncap */
