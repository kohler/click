NotifierQueue
NotifierQueue(CAPACITY)

=s storage

stores packets in a FIFO queue

=d

Stores incoming packets in a first-in-first-out queue.
Drops incoming packets if the queue already holds CAPACITY packets.
The default for CAPACITY is 1000.

NotifierQueue notifies interested parties when it becomes empty and when a
formerly-empty queue receives a packet. The empty notification takes place
some time after the queue goes empty, to prevent thrashing for queues that
hover around 1 or 2 packets long. In all other respects, NotifierQueue behaves
like SimpleQueue.

B<Multithreaded Click note:> NotifierQueue is designed to be used in an
environment with at most one concurrent pusher and at most one concurrent
puller.  Thus, at most one thread pushes to the NotifierQueue at a time and at
most one thread pulls from the NotifierQueue at a time.  Different threads can
push to and pull from the NotifierQueue concurrently, however.  See
ThreadSafeQueue for a queue that can support multiple concurrent pushers and
pullers.

=n

The Queue element acts like NotifierQueue, but additionally notifies
interested parties when it changes state from nonfull to full or vice versa.

=h length read-only

Returns the current number of packets in the queue.

=h highwater_length read-only

Returns the maximum number of packets that have ever been in the queue at once.

=h capacity read/write

Returns or sets the queue's capacity.

=h drops read-only

Returns the number of packets dropped by the queue so far.

=h reset_counts write-only

When written, resets the C<drops> and C<highwater_length> counters.

=h reset write-only

When written, drops all packets in the queue.
